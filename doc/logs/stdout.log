Number: '123' has a delayed palindroom found after '1' iterations of the lychrel algoritm, thus it is not a lychrel number.
Can't find palindroom for base number: '196'  after '17' iterations of the lychrel algoritm. Number thus could be considered a lychrel number.
Number: '4994' is a palindroom, thus it is not a lychrel number.
